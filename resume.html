<p>I have over sixteen years of experience in manufacturing. Working from the bottom up, I learned a lot through those years including how to operate various machinery, manage workflow, and train other team members. As of July 29, 2022 Magister Corporation has permanently shut their doors due to the supply chain crisis. I had an interest in programming and coding and began studying foundational computer languages so that I could start a new career.</p>
